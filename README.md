# PD-Task02

Simple To-Do List (Terminal Based)

A basic terminal-based To-Do list manager built using Python. It lets you quickly add, view, and remove tasks — everything saved in a plain text file so you don’t lose your work.

I created this primarily for personal practice and to improve my basic file handling and logic building skills in Python.

Features:
- Add new tasks from the terminal
- View all tasks with automatic numbering
- Remove tasks by number
- Tasks are saved in a .txt file (so they persist after closing the app)
- Fully written with functions and a class-based version is also available

How to Use:
Just run the script:
   bash
python todo.py
